# PPE Detection Using YOLOv8

## Project Overview
This project implements a real-time Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) detection system using YOLOv8, aimed at enhancing safety measures on construction sites. The model detects whether personnel are wearing safety gear such as hardhats, safety vests, and masks.

## Dataset
The model was trained on the Construction Site Safety Image dataset, which includes various classes of PPE and personnel engaged in different activities.

## Model Training
- Trained a YOLOv8 model specifically tailored for detecting PPE in diverse construction site environments.
- The model was optimized to recognize multiple items, including hardhats, masks, and safety vests with high accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- YOLOv8 for object detection.
- OpenCV for video stream processing and real-time interaction.
- Python for scripting and integration.

## How to Run
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required packages:
```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python cvzone
